# Model generation

All the models part of the package are generated using the [genmodel_classification.py](genmodel_classification.py) file. The input to the file are YAML files where the network structure is defined. Based on the inputs from the YAML file, the model is generated and returned.

If you need a model whose architecture is not available, you can provide your own YAML file in the format mentioned below to get the model generated.
